# FASTSHARE
Fastshare is the backend banking app that lets users create account, login and perform P2P transfer. It is built with Node/ExpressJs. A user creates a unique walletId and any choice four digit pin. Jsonwebtoken is integrated for implementing the permission(authorization and authentication) of the user. The database is MongoDB 


The system is similar to cashapp. However payment gateway hasnt been integrated for users to fund their wallet or tranfer to an account outside the system. Basically just the CRUD and security/permissions has been implemented.
